# Blog API Add Integration Testing Challenge

This is a CRUD API for a blogging platform using Heroku for the server and MLab for the database.

## Requirements

Add integration tests for all four of the API endpoints. Your integration tests should use the strategy described in the previous assignment (set up db in known state, make a request to API, inspect response, inspect state of db, and tear down db). At a minimum, you should write tests for the normal case for each endpoint.

As always, be sure to commit your changes and push up to GitHub as you go along.

Give yourself up to three hours to complete this challenge. When you're done, submit a link to your work on GitHub.
